## 🐉 Enemy: Dynamic Programming Dragon  
❤️ Health: 100  

---

<details>
<summary>⚡ Attack with Binary Search</summary>

❌ Weak Attack!  
The Dragon resists divide & conquer!

❤️ Health Remaining: 90

</details>

<details>
<summary>🌳 Attack with DFS</summary>

❌ Not Effective!  
The Dragon is not a graph problem!

❤️ Health Remaining: 80

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎯 Attack with Greedy</summary>

❌ Wrong Strategy!  
Greedy fails for optimal substructure here!

❤️ Health Remaining: 70

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧠 Attack with Dynamic Programming</summary>

🔥 SUPER EFFECTIVE!  
You identified overlapping subproblems!

🏆 Enemy Defeated!  
❤️ Health: 0

# 🎮 Code Odyssey – A DSA Adventure 🚀

Welcome, Developer 🧠  
You wake up in the **Land of Algorithms**.  
A mysterious voice says:

> "Only the true problem solver can escape..."

---

## 🏰 Level 1: The Array Kingdom

A monster appears holding an unsorted array:
`[5, 1, 9, 2, 7]`

What do you do?

➡️ [Sort the Array using Bubble Sort](#bubble)  
➡️ [Use Merge Sort for faster performance](#merge)

---

## 🫧 Bubble Sort Path
You chose simplicity...

⏳ Time Complexity: O(n²)  
The monster laughs.

❌ Too Slow! You lost precious time.

🔙 [Go Back to Level 1](#-level-1-the-array-kingdom)

---

## 🔥 Merge Sort Path
You chose wisely...

⚡ Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
The array is sorted instantly!

🏆 Monster Defeated!

➡️ [Proceed to Level 2: The Graph Forest](#-level-2-the-graph-forest)

---

## 🌲 Level 2: The Graph Forest

You must find the shortest path to escape.

Choose your strategy:

➡️ [Use DFS](#dfs)  
➡️ [Use BFS](#bfs)

---

## 🌳 DFS
You explore deeply…

❌ You got lost in recursion!

🔙 [Go Back to Level 2](#-level-2-the-graph-forest)

---

## 🚀 BFS
You explore level by level…

✔ Shortest path found!

🏆 Forest Cleared!

---

# 🎉 Congratulations, DSA Explorer!

You escaped using logic, optimization, and correct algorithm selection.
